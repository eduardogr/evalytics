This project defines the Performance Evaluation Cycle as a process **_platform-free_**.

**What does _platform-free_ mean?**

It means that Evalytics is adaptable to the different ecosystems of the different companies depending on the stack of technology they use

> e.g. Google, Microsoft, Slack, own webhooks or services, ... etc 

Satisfying heterogeneous requirements and adapting them in a single project where we can choose the technological stack we want to use.

**Is your company's technology stack covered with Evalytics?**

If your company's technology stack is not satisfied with Evalytics, please, let us know and open a [feature request](https://github.com/eduardogr/evalytics/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md).

## :book: Performance Evaluation Cycle

### Glossary :speech_balloon:

- **Employee**: any person that participate in the process reviewing or being reviewed.
- **Direct report**: from the manager's perspective, an employee that belongs to a team
- **Manager**: an employee that leads a group of employees, their direct reports.
- **Peer**: an employee that co-work with another but with no management relationship.
- **Survey**: Set of questions to answer. It is related to the area of employees and the relationship of employees.
- **Eval reports**: Set of responses and data extracted from employee surveys.

### Types of evaluations

- 180ยบ
    - Employees are going to review theirselves, their manager and their direct reports (if they have it).
- 360ยบ
    - 180ยบ evaluation + evaluation of their peers.

### Phases of a Performance Evaluation Cycle

- Peers assignment (just for 360ยบ evaluations)
    - Here managers are going to decide who is going to review each of their direct reports.

- Review phase
    - Reviewers gonna review.

- End phase
    - Gathering surveys' responses and extracting data from them.
    - Sharing **_eval reports_** with managers

## :pencil: Evalytics Config

There's an [Evalytics config](./config.yaml.example) to help you configure your Evalytics instance:

* **Eval process**

  - id: Evalytics process ID.
  - due_date: Evalytics provider for communications delivery. e.g. gmail.
  - feature_disabling:

* **Providers**

  - storage: Evalytics provider for storage. e.g. google drive.
  - communication_channel: Evalytics provider for communications delivery. e.g. gmail.
  - forms_platform: Evalytics provider for surveys. e.g. google forms.

* **Company**

  - domain: domain of your company, e.g. mycompany.com. This will be used for email delivery.
  - number_of_employees: number of employees in your [orgchart file](./examples/eval-process/0_existing_OrgChart.csv)

* **Gmail provider**

  - mail_subject: Email subject for eval delivery communications.
  - reminder_mail_subject: Email subject for reminder communications.

* **Google Drive provider**

  - folder: Google Drive folder where files are stored.
  - org_chart: Google Spreadsheet where employees are listed. [See an example](./examples/eval-process/0_existing_OrgChart.csv).
  - form_map: Google Spreadsheet where employees forms are listed by kind of form. [See an example](./examples/eval-process/0_existing_FormMap.csv).
  - form_responses_folder: Google Drive folder where response files are stored.
  - eval_report_template_id: Google Document ID where we've defined our eval report template. [See an example](./examples/eval-process/0_existing_EvalReportTemplate.md).
  - eval_report_prefix_name: Prefix for eval reports documents we are going to create.
      - e.g. if prefix is 'Eval Report: ', files generated for employee1 and employee2 are going to have titles; 'Eval Report: employee1' and 'Eval Report: employee2' 

Create a config.yaml file from [config.yaml.example](./config.yaml.example) with correct values for each key to let Evalytics work properly.

## :wrench: Google setup for Evalytics

### Google API credentials

#### Create a Google project :zap:

Just access to [Google APIs](https://console.developers.google.com/).

  - Or [click here](https://console.developers.google.com/projectcreate) for a quick project creation.

#### Create credentials for your project :key:

Once you have created your project, you can create your project's credentials.

To manage project's credentials you have the section [api/credentials](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials) within [Google APIs](https://console.developers.google.com/). But if this is your first credentials creation you better follow these steps:

  - First, you have to create the [consent](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials/consent) for your project
  - Once the consent is already created and you have a name for you google app you can create your credentials:
      - Go to *+ Create Credentials* and select *OAuth ID client*
      - Or access to [api/credentials/oauthclient](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials/oauthclient)
      - The OAuth client type is *other* and choose the name you prefer :smiley:

You have already created your credentials! :fireworks:

Just place them in a `credentials.json` file in the root of this repository. :heavy_exclamation_mark::heavy_exclamation_mark:

#### Enable Google APIs :books:

You can see where you have to access for each google api in the doc [google apis usage](doc/google-apis/usage.md)

#### Generating your token.pickle :unlock:

To authenticate us we have to send a token.pickle to Google APIs, this token.pickle is generated using the file credentials.json.

To generate this we have the make target google-auth, so, you just have to tun

  - `make google-auth`


:warning: Credentials files to authenticate yourself are included in our [.gitignore](.gitignore)

:angel: So, you don't have to worry about that :smiley:

### Evalytics google files examples

```
examples/
        eval-process/: Example documents for each eval subprocess
        google-api-client/: Example clients for each google api that we use
```
