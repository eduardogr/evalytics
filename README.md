## Setting up the project 

### :zap: Create a Google project

Just access to [Google APIs](https://console.developers.google.com/).

  - Or [click here](https://console.developers.google.com/projectcreate) for a quick project creation.

### :key: Create credentials for your project

Once you have created your project, you can create your project's credentials.

To manage project's credentials you have the section [api/credentials](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials) within [Google APIs](https://console.developers.google.com/). But if this is your first credentials creation you better follow these steps:

  - First, you have to create the [consent](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials/consent) for your project
  - Once the consent is already created and you have a name for you google app you can create your credentials:
      - Go to *+ Create Credentials* and select *OAuth ID client*
      - Or access to [api/credentials/oauthclient](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials/oauthclient)
      - The OAuth client type is *other* and choose the name you prefer :smiley:

:fireworks: You have already created your credentials!

:heavy_exclamation_mark: Just place them in a `credentials.json` file in the root of this repository.

### :books: Enable APIs

You can see where you have to access for each google api in the doc [google apis usage](doc/google-apis/usage.md)

### :unlock: Generating your token.pickle

To authenticate us we have to send a token.pickle to Google APIs, this token.pickle is generated using the file credentials.json.

To generate this we have the make target google-auth, so, you just have to tun

  - `make google-auth`



:warning: Credentials files to authenticate yourself are included in our [.gitignore](.gitignore) 

:angel: So, you don't have to worry about that :smiley:



## Running evalytics

Preparing local environment to run evalytics:

```
# Could be env=dev for development
make build env=prod 
make google-auth
make run-server
# If you are developing, for reload code within docker container
make run  stop-server && make start-server 
```

Requesting evalytics:

```
curl -s localhost:8080/start -d 'id=201' | json_pp
{
   "message" : "You have started an evaluation process",
   "id" : "201",
   "success" : true
}
```

## Examples

```
examples/
        eval-process/: Example documents for each eval subprocess
        google-api-client/: Example clients for each google api that we use
```
